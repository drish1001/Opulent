# Opulent
A fully material to-do app, that does exactly what it's supposed to and no more. Using opulent you can create tasks and make a description for them. These tasks appear in a list and can set due date. Where Opulent differs is with an emphasis on Owl The Day â€” namely, the idea that you start each day with a clean start and take a moment at the start of each day to write down what you really want to get achieved that day.
